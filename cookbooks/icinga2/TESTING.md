# Testing
## Prerequisites
We recommend to install [ChefDK] to your development environment.
It provides all tools used in the process of testig this cookbook.

Before starting, make sure you have installed all dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Icinga/chef-icinga2.git
cd chef-icinga2
```

## Integration
### Requirements
* [Vagrant]
* [VirtualBox] (other Vagrant provider may work but are not tested)

### Run Tests
To run all test suits on all platforms:
```shell
kitchen test
```

Instead of running all integration tests, you can specify each suite and platform to create the instances.
All steps can be run separately.
```
kitchen create server-ubuntu-1404
kitchen converge server-ubuntu-1404
kitchen setup server-ubuntu-1404
kitchen verify server-ubuntu-1404
kitchen destroy server-ubuntu-1404
```

List existing instances
```shell
kitchen list
```

## Spec

```shell
/opt/chefdk/bin/chef exec rake spec
```

## Foodcritic
Linting is done with [Foodcritic]:
```shell
/opt/chefdk/bin/chef exec rake foodcritic
```
